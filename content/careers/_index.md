### who we are

We are a dedicated team of workers who take pride in our union membership. Our mission is to democratize the workplace and bring fairness to all.

Many brick-and-mortar clothing shops choose to be hostile against the right to collectively bargain...we are different. We care about the wellbeing and freedom of our workers to fight for a better work life for all.
