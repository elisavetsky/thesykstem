## Our Cookie Policy

1. This agreement applies specifically to EU customers, but is applied broadly.

2. We use session cookies. These are cookies that are required for the operation of our Website and expire when you close your browser. They include, for example, cookies that enable you to log into secure areas of our Website, use a shopping cart or make use of e-billing services. These are used to bring up your account, should you have created one when you return to our Website.

3. Do Not Track. Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to online services you visit. Note, however, there is no industry consensus as to what site operators should in response to these signals. We respond to these signals, although we do not track you in the first place. For more information on “Do Not Track,” visit http://www.allaboutdnt.com.
