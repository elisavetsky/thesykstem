This isn't a question, but we get this one **a lot** and while it may seem that we are...**we aren't**. 

We operate as a pro-worker shop because we simply believe that they are the backbone of this company and we want to reward them more than fairly for being so. Just because we are unionized does not mean that everyone earns the exact same. We would just like to see more companies follow suit in the pursuit of great working conditions and happy employees. Our employees' happiness matters a great deal to us.
