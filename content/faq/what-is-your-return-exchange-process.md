You have 30 days to process your return from the shipping date. All eligible returns will be considered and all hangtags must be attached with the original packaging. For returns by mail, a $4.20 processing fee will be auto-deducted from your returned amount.

We ask you to please allow up to 2 weeks for processing to allow our team to quality check & inspect all returns.
