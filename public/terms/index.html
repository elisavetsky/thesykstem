<p><strong>ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER – IMPORTANT – PLEASE REVIEW AS THIS AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</strong></p>
<p><strong>MANDATORY INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION; WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY.</strong>  EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW, YOU AGREE THAT ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US OR ANY OF OUR OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AGENTS, SERVICE PROVIDERS, CONTRACTORS, SUBCONTRACTORS, OR EMPLOYEES RELATED TO OR ARISING IN ANY WAY FROM USE OF THE SERVICES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PURCHASES MADE ON THE SITE), WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION BEFORE A SINGLE ARBITRATOR UNDER THE JAMS, INC. (“JAMS”) RULES FOR ARBITRATION OF CONSUMER-RELATED DISPUTES (INCLUDING THE JAMS “CONSUMER ARBITRATION MINIMUM STANDARDS”). <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/consumer-minimum-standards/">https://www.jamsadr.com/consumer-minimum-standards/</a> YOU AND THE SYKSTEM FURTHER EXPRESSLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PURSUE CLAIMS VIA A CLASS ACTION OR CLASS-BASED ARBITRATION. THIS AGREEMENT IS BINDING ON YOU AND THE SYKSTEM, AS WELL AS OUR RESPECTIVE HEIRS, SUCCESSORS, AND ASSIGNS.</p>
<p>SOLE EXCEPTION TO INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION REQUIREMENT:  YOU OR WE MAY SEEK INJUNCTIVE OR OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF IN ANY STATE OR FEDERAL COURT HAVING JURISDICTION TO GRANT IT IN THE EVENT OF AN ACTUAL OR THREATENED INFRINGEMENT OR MISAPPROPRIATION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.</p>
<p>You agree that all arbitrations under this agreement, and disputes related to such arbitrations, involve commerce under and are governed by Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), and are not governed by state and local laws, or the laws of other countries, including those concerning or purporting to place limits on the availability or scope of arbitration.</p>
<p>Discovery and rights to appeal in arbitration are generally more limited than in a lawsuit, and other rights that you and we would have in court may not be available in arbitration.  However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages) and must follow these Terms as a court would.</p>
<p>You agree that the arbitrator has the authority to and shall resolve all claims and issues arising between us, including, but not limited to, all claims arising under international, federal, state, and local statutory, regulatory, constitutional, and common law.</p>
<p>You further agree that this arbitration requirement covers, but is not limited to, any and all claims arising from or related in any way to your use or receipt of the Services (including your use of the Site), your registration with the Site, your requests to receive advertising or promotions, your purchase of or attempt to purchase products from us, and any communications between us.</p>
<p>YOU ALSO AGREE THAT ARBITRATOR ALSO HAS THE SOLE AUTHORITY TO AND SHALL ADDRESS ALL CLAIMS OR ARGUMENTS BY EITHER PARTY CONCERNING THE FORMATION, LEGALITY, SCOPE, AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS ARBITRATION CLAUSE, INCLUDING THE ARBITRABILITY OF ANY CLAIM OR ISSUE ARISING BETWEEN US.</p>
<p>If you initiate an arbitration, we will reimburse you for any standard filing fee required for claims under $10,000. For claims over $10,000, payment of such fees will be by a separate agreement between you and us. If we cannot agree on such payment, the arbitrator will decide how such fees should be paid and by whom.  Each party shall be responsible for their own attorneys’ fees except as provided by applicable law or the JAMS rules.</p>
<p>We are committed to providing for dispute resolution at a reasonable cost to consumers consistent with the JAMS rules, and any matters related to such cost, if not agreed to by you and us, will be decided by the arbitrator.</p>
<p>To the extent that any other provision of the Terms of Service is found to be inconsistent with rights, duties, and requirements of this arbitration agreement, or where the application of such a provision would change or render unenforceable any part of this arbitration agreement, such provision shall be deemed null and void and the terms of this arbitration agreement shall control with regard to any arbitration between issue.</p>
<p><strong>Small Claims Court.</strong> As an alternative, we may bring our claims in your local “small claims” court, if permitted by that small claims court&rsquo;s rules and if such claim is within such court’s jurisdiction. Any such action, however, may not be transferred, removed or appealed to a different court.</p>
<p><strong>Class Action Waiver.</strong>  You may bring claims only on your own behalf. Neither you nor we will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this agreement.</p>
<p><strong>YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS MEMBER ON ANY CLASS CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE AGAINST US, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY RIGHT TO CLASS ARBITRATION OR ANY CONSOLIDATION OF INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATIONS. YOU ALSO AGREE NOT TO PARTICIPATE IN CLAIMS BROUGHT IN A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL OR REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY, OR CONSOLIDATED CLAIMS INVOLVING ANOTHER PERSON’S ACCOUNT, IF WE ARE A PARTY TO THE PROCEEDING.</strong></p>
<h4 id="procedures">Procedures</h4>
<p>In the event that JAMS is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of filing the case, then either we or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the American Arbitration Association under its Consumer Arbitration Rules and the Consumer Due Process Protocol (collectively, &ldquo;AAA Rules&rdquo;).</p>
<p>Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of, related to or connected with the use of the Services or these Terms must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever banned.</p>
<h4 id="30-day-opt-out-period">30-Day Opt-Out Period</h4>
<p>If you do not wish to be bound by the arbitration and class-action waiver provisions in this Disputes section, you must notify us in writing within thirty (30) days of the date that you first accept these Terms (unless a longer period is required by applicable law), and then you must resolve any disputes against us in accordance with the “Governing Law” section above. Your written notification must be mailed to us at: the sykstem, Attn: Legal, 123 Hollywood Blvd., Fl 1, Los Angeles, CA 12345.</p>
<p>If you do not notify us in accordance with this paragraph, you agree to be bound by the terms of this Disputes section, including, without limitation, the arbitration and class-action waiver provisions, and further including such provisions in any revisions we make to these Terms after the date of your first acceptance. Such notification must include: (i) your name; (ii) your email address and mailing address; and (iii) a statement that you do not wish to resolve disputes with us through arbitration or waive your ability to participate in a class action.</p>
<p>If we make any changes to this Disputes section (other than a change to the address at which we will receive notices or rejections of future changes to this Disputes section), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice, within thirty (30) days of the change, to the address set out in this paragraph. It is not necessary to send us a rejection of a future change to this Disputes section if you had properly opted out within the first thirty (30) days after you first accepted the provisions in this Disputes section. If you have not properly opted out, then by rejecting a future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this Disputes section, as modified by any changes you did not reject.</p>
<p>A notification sent pursuant to this paragraph solely affects these Terms; if you previously entered into other arbitration or dispute resolution agreements with us or enter into other such agreements in the future, your notification that you are opting out of the provisions in this Disputes section shall not affect the other arbitration agreements between you and us.</p>
